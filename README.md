# Bootstrap Project Management (BPM)

A minimal, outcomes-first way to run projects when the usual frameworks are too heavy, too slow, or just don’t work in the real world.

## What it’s about

- **Outcomes** – success = customer signs off. Nothing else counts.  
- **Minimalism** – only use what earns its place. Tools, docs, meetings — cut the rest.  
- **Flexibility** – projects move, budgets shift, people vanish. BPM bends, pivots, survives.  

## Why it exists

Because in consulting you deal with:

- Customers changing goals halfway but still wanting the budget spent  
- Budgets running out and projects having to pivot  
- Fights over who owns and supports what was built  
- Pressure to burn budget by a date, not deliver value  
- Gatekeepers slowing things down on purpose  
- Third-party IT refusing to move without a work order  
- People disappearing without notice  
- Teams across timezones never quite in sync  
- Consultants making changes behind the PM’s back  
- Being parachuted into a failing project and told to “make it look like success”  

Frameworks don’t cover this. BPM does.

## How it works (in practice)

- Lock down **outcomes** and KPIs. If halfway, map what’s signed off, what’s left, what needs renogiating.  
- Run kick-offs with every stakeholder group (customer, internal, partner). Identify key decision makers.  
- Document what each stakeholder actually wants. Customer stake is top priority.  
- Get sign-off on outcomes and KPIs. Evidence matters — contract, email, whatever.  
- Build the delivery plan: kanban, gantt, grid — doesn’t matter. Outcomes as milestones. Plan is alive, not fixed.  
- Keep a lighter customer plan — milestones only, including theirs and their 3rd party deliverables.  
- Watch the budget. If it’s going to run over, tell the customer straight and renegotiate.  
- Spot undocumented changes? File a retroactive change request and get sign-off.  
- Sign-off locks the work. Once it’s signed, it’s done.  

## What it’s not
- It’s not Agile with a new hat.  
- It’s not Waterfall with a new name.  
- The second you graft that stuff on, it stops being Bootstrap.
