# Hostility Management

Not every project fails because of bad tech or bad estimates.
Sometimes it’s people. Politics. Fear. Sabotage.
The [Alchemist (PM)](../method/roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) must spot hostility early and deal with it head-on.

## Where Hostility Comes From

- **3rd parties** who see you as competition or a threat (often the [Gatekeepers (3rd Parties & Blockers)](../method/roles.md#the-gatekeepers-3rd-parties-artisans-potential-blockers)).
- **Employees** who fear their job is being automated away.
- **Change resisters** who just don’t want disruption.
- **Internal politics** — turf wars between departments.
- **Vested interests** who benefit if the project stalls.

## Spotting Hostility

- Watch the vibe in kick-offs and daily calls.
- Slow replies, sudden dissapearnces, repeated blockers, passive-aggressive comms.
- SMEs who say “we’ll get to it” but never do.
- Partners who drown you in process.

**Rule:** if it smells like resistance, treat it as resistance.

## What To Do

1. **Document It**
   - Every delay, every blocker, every excuse — write it down.
   - Evidence is your shield.

2. **Escalate to the Custodian Early**
   - Don’t fight turf wars yourself.
   - Raise it to the [Custodian (Customer KDM)](../method/roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc): *“This blocker is jeopardising your outcome.”*

3. **Reframe in Outcomes**  
   - Put hostility back in terms of outcomes/KPIs.
   - *“If X doesn’t deliver this input, Y outcome cannot be signed off.”*
   - Shifts the blame from you to the blocker.

4. **Use Assumption Reflex**
   - *“If I don’t hear from you by EOD, I’ll proceed with assumption Z.”*
   - Forces a response.

5. **Timebox the Resistance**
   - Convert waiting into milestones: *“Firewall request submitted, 5-day SLA.”*
   - Makes blockers visible and trackable.

## Dealing with Sabotage

- **Mild sabotage** (dragging feet, excuses): document, escalate, reframe.
- **Severe sabotage** (malicious changes, deleted work, deliberate disruption):
  - Halt work on the affected area.
  - Escalate immediately to the [Custodian (Customer KDM)](../method/roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) and exec sponsors ([King (Executive Authority)](../method/roles.md#the-king-executive-authority) / [Castellan (Account Manager)](../method/roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager)).
  - Present evidence.
  - Make it their problem, not yours.

## Notes

- Stay professional, but firm.
- You’re not here to win hearts.
- You’re here to get outcomes signed off.

Hostility isn’t personal — it’s politics, fear, or turf.
Don’t wrestle in the mud. Document, escalate, reframe, move on.

Not all hostility that comes at you comes for you.
I once worked with a guy who was constantly complaining
about how uncooperative I was being - even after I had gone the
extra mile (outside of scope) to assist him.
Months after the project ended and I'd moved on, I heard he had
passed away from an aggressive terminal cancer. Most people
are dealing with things we have no idea about.
