# Bootstrap-PM Reference Tools

Bootstrap-PM uses a mix of light but effective tools.
They are not heavyweight frameworks — they are lenses, prompts, and trackers to help you keep projects moving.
Below is a quick reference with summaries and links to learn more.

## Pre-mortems

Imagine the project has already failed. Work backwards: what went wrong?
This surfaces risks before they happen and forces uncomfortable truths into the open.

- Use when: starting a project, mid-flight pivots.
- Outcome: list of “likely failure modes” → actions to prevent them.

## 5W1H

Ask: **Who, What, Where, When, Why, How**.
A simple framework to make sure you’ve captured all angles before deciding.

- Use when: scoping, clarifying ambiguous tasks, during kick-offs.
- Outcome: a full picture without missing context.

## 5 Whys

Keep asking “why?” until you uncover the root cause of a problem. Usually takes five rounds, sometimes more.

- Use when: tracking delays, effort mismatch, or recurring issues.
- Outcome: root cause identified and addressed, not just symptoms.

## RAG Status

Red–Amber–Green traffic light indicator. Quick snapshot of health.

- Use when: reporting to Custodians or Kings.
- Outcome: visibility at a glance.

## RACI

**Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.** Clarifies who does what.

- Use when: stakes are unclear or overlapping.
- Outcome: no confusion over roles.

## Outcomes

End states that satisfy the customer.
In Bootstrap-PM, outcomes matter more than tasks. An outcome can be achieved in many ways, including by *doing nothing!*

- Use when: project scoping, sign-off definition.
- Outcome: “we’re satisfied” evidence.

## KPIs

Key Performance Indicators. Measurable signals tied to outcomes.

- Use when: turning outcomes into numbers/evidence.
- Outcome: clarity on what success looks like.

## Stake Maps

Visual map of who holds stakes in the project, and what they want.

- Use when: aligning Custodians, Artisans, Envoys, and Gatekeepers.
- Outcome: clear visibility of competing interests.

## Kanban / Gantt

Two ways to show the plan:

- **Kanban** = flow of tasks, “pull” system, easy to adapt.
- **Gantt** = timeline of tasks and dependencies, good for external visibility.

- Use when: visualising progress and dependencies.
- Outcome: live plan everyone can see.

## Fermi Estimates

Quick back-of-envelope estimates by breaking a big unknown into smaller guesses. Named after physicist Enrico Fermi.

- Use when: ambiguity is high, data is missing.
- Outcome: rough effort/time numbers you can buffer.

## Burn Charts

Track work remaining over time. **Burn down** = tasks left to do. **Burn up** = tasks completed.

- Use when: monitoring effort vs time.
- Outcome: visibility of whether you’re on track.
