# Bootstrapping

Bootstrap Project Management isn’t about phases or rigid playbooks.  
It’s repeatable, lightweight, and focused on outcomes.  

## Step 1 — Startup

- Establish what's been bought and sold.
- Assemble the team.
- If mid-project: take inventory (signed off / pending / disputed).

## Step 2 - Outcomes

- Lock down **what makes the customer say “yes, we’re satisfied.”**.
- Translate into KPIs with measurable evidence.

## Step 3 — Kick-offs

- Run **internal kickoff** first (delivery team). Agree feasibility, effort, and plan.  
- Run **customer kickoff** next. Present plan, KPIs, and milestones.  
- Run **partner kickoff** if 3rd parties are critical.  

## Step 4 - The Stakes

- Document stakes for every group. Customer stake is top priority.
- Develop a stake map, understand who wants what.

## Step 5 — Plan & Estimate

- Build the **Delivery Plan** (granular, outcomes as milestones).
- Build the **Customer Plan** (milestones only, includes their deliverables).
- Forecast effort: classify tasks as BAU / ambiguous / unknown.
- Use **Fermi estimates** with buffer (x1.5).
- Iron rule: no task without an estimate.

## Step 6 — Execute & Track

- Work the plan.
- Track effort vs. time — if % time >> % done, raise a flag.
- Use light tools: burn charts, RAG status, kanban.
- Document blockers, escalate to KDM early.
- Stay in lawyer/detective mode — gather evidence, run pre-mortems.

## Step 7 — Manage Change

- **Ordinary changes:** log early, include effort + timescale, run through approvals.
- **Retroactive changes:** document no matter what, classify (small / medium / high).
- Escalate medium/high to KDM.
- No undocumented change goes unlogged.

## Step 8 — Sign-offs

- Present outcomes + KPI evidence.
- Get explicit sign-off (contract, email, note, ticket).
- Store it in the Evidence folder under milestone.
- No sign-off = no closure.
- If refused, run the resolution process (satisfaction gap, incomplete work, impossible ask, or abandonment).

### Pivot or Close

- If scope, budget, or outcomes shift → loop back to Step 1.
- If outcomes signed off → milestone closed, project continues or ends.
- If abandoned → trigger last resort (formal closure + legal prep).

# Iron Bootstrap Rules

- Outcomes are everything. All tasks tie to an outcome.
- Customer stake comes first. If stakes clash, the customer wins.
- The project doesn't start until every task has been estimated.
- Evidence or it didn’t happen.
- No empty folders. Empty folders = failure to commit or failure to deliver.
- No change goes unlogged.
- Sign-off is closure. No sign-off, no closure.
