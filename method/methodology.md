# Bootstrapping

Bootstrap Project Management isn’t about phases or rigid playbooks.
It’s repeatable, lightweight, and focused on outcomes.

## Step 1 — [Startup](./1_startup.md) & [Mid-Flight Takeover](./1a_mid-project_takeover.md)

- Establish what’s been bought and sold (from the Sales [Envoy](./roles.md#the-envoy-sales)).
- Assemble the team: PM ([Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager)), Account Manager ([Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager)), Consultants/Delivery Team ([Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme)).
- If mid-project: take inventory of what’s been signed off by the customer [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc), what’s pending, and what’s disputed.

## Step 2 — [Defining Outcomes](./2_outcomes.md)

- Lock down what makes the Customer Exec (the [King](./roles.md#the-king-executive-authority)) say **“yes, we’re satisfied.”**
- Translate into KPIs with measurable evidence.
- [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) documents, [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) clarify feasibility, [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) approves.

## Step 3 — [Kick-offs](./3_kickoffs.md)

- Run **internal kickoff** ([Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) + [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) + [Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager)). Agree feasibility, effort, and plan.
- Run **customer kickoff** (Key Decision Maker ([Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc)) + Customer Team (the [Artisans](./roles.md#the-artisans-customer-smes)). Present plan, KPIs, and milestones.
- Run **partner kickoff** if [Gatekeepers](./roles.md#the-gatekeepers-3rd-parties-artisans-potential-blockers) are critical.

## Step 4 — [The Stakes](./4_stakes.md)

- Document stakes for every group: [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc), [King](./roles.md#the-king-executive-authority), [Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager), [Artisans](./roles.md#the-artisans-customer-smes), [Envoy](./roles.md#the-envoy-sales), [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme), [Gatekeepers](./roles.md#the-gatekeepers-3rd-parties-artisans-potential-blockers).
- Customer stake ([King](./roles.md#the-king-executive-authority)) is top priority.
- Develop a stake map: who wants what, and why.

## Step 5 — [Plan & Estimate](./5_planning.md)

- Build the **Delivery Plan** ([Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) + [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme)). Outcomes as milestones.
- Build the **Customer Plan** ([Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) + [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) + [Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager)). Milestones only, includes their deliverables.
- Forecast effort: classify tasks as BAU / ambiguous / unknown.
- [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) provide estimates, [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) applies buffers (x1.5).
- Iron rule: no task without an estimate.

## Step 6 — [Execute & Track](./6_tracking.md)

- [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) do the work, [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) tracks it, [Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager) keeps continuity.
- Track effort vs. time — if % time >> % done, raise a flag to the [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc).
- Use light tools: burn charts, RAG status, kanban.
- Document blockers, escalate to [Gatekeepers](./roles.md#the-gatekeepers-3rd-parties-artisans-potential-blockers) via [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) if needed.
- Stay in lawyer/detective mode — [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) gathers evidence, runs pre-mortems.

## Step 7 — [Manage Change](./7_change.md)

- **Ordinary changes:** [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) logs, [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) clarify effort, [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) approves.
- **Retroactive changes:** [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) documents, escalates medium/high to [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc).
- No undocumented change goes unlogged.

## Step 8 — [Sign-offs](./8_sign_off.md)

- [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) presents outcomes + KPI evidence.
- [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) provides explicit sign-off (contract, email, ticket).
- Store in the Evidence folder under milestone.
- No sign-off = no closure.

If sign-off is refused:
- [Alchemist](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) investigates satisfaction gap.
- [Knights](./roles.md#the-knight-sme) patch if incomplete.
- [Custodian](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) decides if scope shift is acceptable.
- [Castellan](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager) manages relationship fallout.

### Pivot or Close

- If scope, budget, or outcomes shift → loop back to Step 1.
- If outcomes signed off → milestone closed, project continues or ends.
- If abandoned → trigger last resort (formal closure + legal prep).

## Rules

| | Iron Bootstrap Rules |
| - | - |
| 1 | Outcomes are everything. Outcomes are pinned by deliverables. All tasks tie to a deliverable.
| 2 | No task is undertaken without a measure of success and completion.
| 3 | The project doesn’t start until every task has been estimated.
| 4 | Evidence or it didn’t happen.
| 5 | No empty folders. Empty folders = failure to commit or failure to deliver.
| 6 | No change goes unlogged.
| 7 | Sign-off is closure.
| 8 | All bootstrap projects have an end.
| 9 | Bootstrap expects things to go wrong and plans for those eventualities.
