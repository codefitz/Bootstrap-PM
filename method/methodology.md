# Bootstrapping

Bootstrap Project Management isn’t about phases or rigid playbooks.
It’s repeatable, lightweight, and focused on outcomes.

## Step 1 — Startup

- Establish what’s been bought and sold (from the Envoy).
- Assemble the team: Seneschal, Castellan, Knights.
- If mid-project: take inventory of what’s been signed off by the Custodian, what’s pending, and what’s disputed.

## Step 2 — Outcomes

- Lock down **what makes the Custodian say “yes, we’re satisfied.”**
- Translate into KPIs with measurable evidence.
- Seneschal documents, Knights clarify feasibility, Custodian approves.

## Step 3 — Kick-offs

- Run **internal kickoff** (Seneschal + Knights + Castellan). Agree feasibility, effort, and plan.
- Run **customer kickoff** (Custodian + Artisans). Present plan, KPIs, and milestones.
- Run **partner kickoff** if Gatekeepers are critical.

## Step 4 — The Stakes

- Document stakes for every group: Custodian, King, Castellan, Artisans, Envoy, Knights, Gatekeepers.
- Customer stake (Custodian) is top priority.
- Develop a stake map: who wants what, and why.

## Step 5 — Plan & Estimate

- Build the **Delivery Plan** (Seneschal + Knights). Outcomes as milestones.
- Build the **Customer Plan** (Seneschal + Custodian + Castellan). Milestones only, includes their deliverables.
- Forecast effort: classify tasks as BAU / ambiguous / unknown.
- Knights provide estimates, Seneschal applies buffers (x1.5).
- Iron rule: no task without an estimate.

## Step 6 — Execute & Track

- Knights do the work, Seneschal tracks it, Castellan keeps continuity.
- Track effort vs. time — if % time >> % done, raise a flag to the Custodian.
- Use light tools: burn charts, RAG status, kanban.
- Document blockers, escalate to Gatekeepers via Custodian if needed.
- Stay in lawyer/detective mode — Seneschal gathers evidence, runs pre-mortems.

## Step 7 — Manage Change

- **Ordinary changes:** Seneschal logs, Knights clarify effort, Custodian approves.
- **Retroactive changes:** Seneschal documents, escalates medium/high to Custodian.
- No undocumented change goes unlogged.

## Step 8 — Sign-offs

- Seneschal presents outcomes + KPI evidence.
- Custodian provides explicit sign-off (contract, email, ticket).
- Store in the Evidence folder under milestone.
- No sign-off = no closure.

If sign-off is refused:
- Seneschal investigates satisfaction gap.
- Knights patch if incomplete.
- Custodian decides if scope shift is acceptable.
- Castellan manages relationship fallout.

### Pivot or Close

- If scope, budget, or outcomes shift → loop back to Step 1.
- If outcomes signed off → milestone closed, project continues or ends.
- If abandoned → trigger last resort (formal closure + legal prep).

# Iron Bootstrap Rules

- Outcomes are everything. All tasks tie to an outcome.
- The Custodian’s stake comes first. If stakes clash, the customer wins.
- The project doesn’t start until every task has been estimated.
- Evidence or it didn’t happen.
- No empty folders. Empty folders = failure to commit or failure to deliver.
- No change goes unlogged.
- Sign-off is closure. No sign-off, no closure.
