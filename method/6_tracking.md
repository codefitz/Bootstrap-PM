# Execute and Track (Budget Control)

- **Track like this (daily/bi-daily with the owner):**
  - *“Task was sized at 5 days. We’re 2 days in. Where are we?”*
  - If the SME says **“10% done”**, you have a problem. Either the estimate was wrong, or there’s a gate.

**Probe immediately (5 Whys):**
- Is there a **gate** (e.g. waiting on firewall, access, data, approvals)?
  - **Action:** add a visible milestone/blocker in the plan, name the owner, **escalate to KDM**.
- Is it **underestimated** (we just sized it badly)?
  - **Option 1:** **Borrow** time from other tasks (ideally ones already completed under budget).
  - **Option 2:** **Escalate to KDM** — warn it’s taking longer; renegotiate scope/budget/dates.
  - **Blame wisely:** if it’s a customer dependency, say so (with evidence). If it’s on delivery, **own it** and adjust.

**Smell test:** if **% time elapsed >> % work complete**, raise a flag. Don’t wait for Friday.

## Tooling

Bootstrap PMs don’t worship tools, but they use what works:  
- **Burn charts** (progress vs. effort). Quick visual of whether you’re on track or drifting.  
- **RAG status** (Red/Amber/Green). Fast, brutal clarity for execs. If it’s Red, everyone knows.  
- **Kanban board / task grid**. Delivery plan in motion. Doesn’t matter if it’s Jira, Trello, or a whiteboard.  
- **Simple trackers** (Excel/Sheets). Sometimes the fastest way to keep time vs. progress visible.  

Pick the tool that gives clarity with least drag.

## Cadence & Pressure

- Meeting frequency is a **vibe call**:
  - **Clued-up, demanding customer?** Match their pace. Daily stand-ups are fine.
  - **Laid-back customer?** **Red flag.** Micromanage. When dates slip, blame lands on delivery. Stay ahead of it.

**Your job:** Nag both sides. SMEs may moan, but they’re not paying.  
The goal is **customer satisfaction** — visible progress, clean comms, no surprises.

## Lawyer/Detective Mode

- Always gather **evidence**: decisions, blockers, owner acknowledgements, timestamps.
- Run **pre-mortems**: “If this goes wrong, how will it go wrong?” Then go hunt those failure points now.
- If it does go **tits up**, your trail proves diligence and narrows the fix.

## Quick Checklists

**Tracking**
- [ ] Timebox set (if possible)
- [ ] Daily/bi-daily progress vs. time check
- [ ] Gates logged as blockers, owners named
- [ ] Under-/over-runs balanced or escalated
- [ ] KDM informed early on impact
- [ ] Evidence captured (notes, emails, screenshots)
