# Defining Outcomes

The first job of a Bootstrap PM is to pin down outcomes.  
Not tasks, not tickets, not “stories” — outcomes.  
What is the customer actually paying for? What will they sign their name to and say *yes, that’s what we wanted*?

Frameworks love activity. Bootstrap loves results.

## Fresh Project vs Mid-Project

- **Fresh project**
  Sit down with the customer and ask: *what will make you say this project succeeded?*
  Push until the answers are concrete. Translate each into an outcome statement.

- **Mid-project takeover**
  - Figure out what’s already signed off (if anything).  
  - Figure out what’s still open.  
  - Figure out what’s a mess that needs renogiating.  
  Don’t assume anything. If it’s not written and signed, it’s not real.

## Translating Outcomes into KPIs

Every outcome must have a measurable indicator.  
Not a vanity metric, a real one.

**Template:**

| Outcome                              | KPI                                     | Evidence for Sign-off                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Enable staff to log incidents remotely | 90% of test users can raise a ticket end-to-end | Customer email confirming test results |
| Migrate core finance reports          | 100% of monthly reports produced on new system | Screenshot of reports + CFO email sign-off |
| Reduce time to onboard                | Average onboarding time cut from 3 weeks to 1 week | HR sign-off with before/after stats |

If you can’t measure it, you can’t sign it off.  
And if you can’t sign it off, it will come back to haunt you.

## Evidence is King

For every KPI, there must be proof.  
Email, contract clause, signed doc, even a screenshot with a customer reply saying “yes.”  
Doesn’t matter how small.  

Collect it all in an **"evidence"** folder, typically you can name it 'deliverables', 'products' or 'sign off' - but have it handy for retroactive lookup. I've seen projects and handovers from 2 years ago dug up to determine who agreed to what.

This folder is your shield when disputes come.

## Checklist for Outcomes & KPIs

- [ ] Ask customer: *what makes this project a success for you?*
- [ ] Translate each into a clear outcome statement
- [ ] Attach a KPI to each outcome — simple, measurable
- [ ] Document and agree with key decision makers (KDMs)
- [ ] Store agreed outcomes & KPIs in project folder/repo
- [ ] Create an 'evidence' folder — capture proof as you go

## Tone to Remember

You’re not chasing a perfect backlog.  
You’re not chasing “velocity.”  
You’re not chasing story points.  

You’re chasing a customer signature under an agreed outcome.  
That’s it.
