# Mid-Project Takeover

Sometimes you don’t get the luxury of a clean start.
You’re parachuted into a project already in flight — or already on fire.
Bootstrap PM has a method for this too.

---

## First Rule

- Don’t trust anything you’re told.
- Assume nothing is signed off unless you see the evidence.

## Step 1 — Inventory Outcomes

- Gather all the outcomes that were promised.
- Check what has already been signed off (with evidence).
- List what is still pending.
- Identify what is in dispute.

## Step 2 — Renegotiate the Map

- For everything pending or disputed, clarify with the customer:
  - Is this still required?
  - Has budget/time changed?
  - Do we need to rescope?
- Expect to renegotiate. Use **change management** if scope/budget shifts.

## Step 3 — Quick Wins

- Look for small outcomes that can be delivered fast.
- Secure sign-off quickly to rebuild customer confidence.
- Even minor sign-offs create momentum and buy you breathing room.

## Step 4 — Reset the Stake Map

- Run stakeholder kick-offs (internal, customer, partner) as if the project were fresh.
- Document each stake.
- Expect politics and hostilities — you’re the outsider now.

## Step 5 — Rebuild the Plan

- Draft a new delivery plan from the current reality, not the old fantasy.
- Outcomes as milestones.
- Customer plan stripped to milestones they can agree to.
- Mark everything already signed off as **done** and locked.
- Ambiguous tasks- flag and timebox.

## Step 6 — Evidence Check

- Review the **Evidence folder** (if it exists).
- If it doesn’t exist, build one from scratch.
- Retroactively collect as much as possible: emails, approvals, even informal confirmations.
- Without evidence, you’re exposed.

## Step 7 — Flag the Risks

- Document all gaps, disputes, and hostile behaviours.
- Escalate early to KDM.
- Be explicit: “Here’s what’s at risk, here’s what we need.”
- This isn’t about blame, it’s about protection.

## Step 8 — Communicate the Reset

- Hold a session with all major stakeholders.
- Present the new plan, current status, and risks.
- Get agreement on the way forward.
- Capture that agreement as evidence.

## Checklist

- [ ] Outcomes inventoried (signed off / pending / disputed).
- [ ] Renegotiated pending/disputed items.
- [ ] Quick wins identified and delivered.
- [ ] Stakeholder kick-offs rerun, stakes captured.
- [ ] Delivery plan rebuilt on reality, not legacy.
- [ ] Evidence folder checked or rebuilt.
- [ ] Risks documented and escalated.
- [ ] Reset plan communicated and agreed.

## Tone to Remember

Mid-project takeover is triage.  
Forget the old story, tell the new one.  
Lock down what’s done, renegotiate what’s left, and get the customer to sign onto the new reality.  
That’s survival.
