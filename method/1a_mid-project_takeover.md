# Mid-Project Takeover

Sometimes you don't get the luxury of a clean start.
You're parachuted into a project already in flight — or already on fire.
Bootstrap PM has a method for this too.
Use this alongside the standard [Startup](./1_startup.md) guidance when you're inheriting a live engagement.

---

## First Rule

- Don't trust anything you're told.
- Assume nothing is signed off unless you see the evidence curated in [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).

## Step 1 — Inventory Outcomes

- Gather all the outcomes that were promised (start with [Defining Outcomes](./2_outcomes.md)).
- Check what has already been signed off, with evidence stored per [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).
- List what is still pending.
- Identify what is in dispute.

## Step 2 — Renegotiate the Map

- For everything pending or disputed, clarify with the customer:
  - Is this still required?
  - Has budget or time changed?
  - Do we need to rescope?
- Expect to renegotiate. Use the [Change Management](./7_change.md) playbook if scope or budget shifts.

## Step 3 — Quick Wins

- Look for small outcomes that can be delivered fast.
- Secure sign-off quickly (track the proof using [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md)) to rebuild customer confidence.
- Even minor sign-offs create momentum and buy you breathing room.

## Step 4 — Reset the Stake Map

- Run stakeholder kick-offs (internal, customer, partner) as if the project were fresh; follow the [Stakeholder Kick-offs](./3_kickoffs.md) routine.
- Document each stake in line with the [Stakeholder Stakes](./4_stakes.md) guidance.
- Expect politics and hostilities — you're the outsider now, so prepare with [Hostility Management](../reference/hostility_management.md).

## Step 5 — Rebuild the Plan

- Draft a new delivery plan from the current reality, not the old fantasy, using [Planning](./5_planning.md).
- Keep outcomes as milestones and sync tracking with [Delivery Tracking](./6_tracking.md).
- Customer plan stripped to milestones they can agree to.
- Mark everything already signed off as **done** and locked.
- Ambiguous tasks — flag and timebox.

## Step 6 — Evidence Check

- Review the **Evidence folder** (if it exists).
- If it doesn't exist, build one from scratch following [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).
- Retroactively collect as much as possible: emails, approvals, even informal confirmations.
- Without evidence, you're exposed.

## Step 7 — Flag the Risks

- Document all gaps, disputes, and hostile behaviours.
- Escalate early to the [Custodian (Customer Key Decision Maker)](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc).
- Be explicit: "Here's what's at risk, here's what we need."
- This isn't about blame, it's about protection.

## Step 8 — Communicate the Reset

- Hold a session with all major stakeholders (run it like a [Stakeholder Kick-off](./3_kickoffs.md)).
- Present the new plan, current status, and risks.
- Get agreement on the way forward.
- Capture that agreement as evidence per [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).

## Checklist

- [ ] Outcomes inventoried (signed off / pending / disputed) using [Defining Outcomes](./2_outcomes.md) and [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).
- [ ] Renegotiated pending or disputed items via [Change Management](./7_change.md).
- [ ] Quick wins identified, delivered, and evidenced for [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).
- [ ] Stakeholder kick-offs rerun and stakes captured ([Stakeholder Kick-offs](./3_kickoffs.md) and [Stakeholder Stakes](./4_stakes.md)).
- [ ] Delivery plan rebuilt on reality, not legacy ([Planning](./5_planning.md) and [Delivery Tracking](./6_tracking.md)).
- [ ] Evidence folder checked or rebuilt using [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).
- [ ] Risks documented and escalated to the [Custodian (Customer Key Decision Maker)](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc).
- [ ] Reset plan communicated and agreed, with evidence logged per [Sign-off](./8_sign_off.md).

## Tone to Remember

Mid-project takeover is triage.  
Forget the old story, tell the new one.  
Lock down what's done, renegotiate what's left, and get the customer to sign onto the new reality.  
That's survival.
