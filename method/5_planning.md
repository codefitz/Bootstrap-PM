# Delivery & Customer Plans

Every project needs a plan — but not the bloated, carved-in-stone kind.
Bootstrap plans are alive. They breathe, shift, and evolve.

There are two plans you care about: the Delivery Plan and the Customer Plan.
One is for you and your team. The other is for the people paying.

## Delivery Plan (Living)

- Built for the delivery stake (your team, partners, anyone hands-on).
- Must have **outcomes as milestones**. If it’s not tied to an outcome, it’s noise.
- Format doesn’t matter — kanban board, gantt chart, grid, whatever.
- Granularity rule: every task must directly affect progress. If it doesn’t move the needle, bin it.
- Document owners for tasks. If no one owns it, it won’t get done.
- Keep it alive. Update as things shift. Don’t let it rot.

**Pro tip:** Don’t waste time polishing this into a “beautiful plan.” It’s a tool, not a presentation.

## Customer Plan (Light)

- Built for the customer stakeholders, especially the KDM with the money.
- High-level milestones only — no one outside the delivery team cares about sub-tasks.
- Includes deliverables that the customer and their 3rd parties must produce.
- Should fit in an email or slide.
- Tone = clarity. They need to know what’s coming, when, and what they own.

## The Handshake

Delivery Plan = detail.
Customer Plan = story.

Both must line up. If they drift apart, you’re in trouble.

## When to Pivot

- Budget overrun? → Update both plans.
- Undocumented change? → Only update delivery plan if the change is still in progress. Don't update the customer plan, but document retrospectively.
- Outcome dropped or swapped? → Update both plans.

Living means living. If the plan doesn’t reflect reality, it’s a liability.

## Example

**Delivery Plan Milestone**  
- Outcome: “Migrate core finance reports”
- Tasks: Extract dataset / Transform / Load / Validate / Customer sign-off
- Owner: Dev Lead + Finance SME
- Status: In progress

**Customer Plan Milestone**  
- “Finance reports available in new system by 31st March”
- Customer deliverable: Provide dataset by 15th Feb
- Sign-off: CFO
