# Roles

We all like codenames right?
Bootstrap has codenames too, codenames are cool and make it sound like you're
highly proficient in some sort of mystic business feng shui.

# Chaos Wrangler (The Bootstrap PM)

The most important character in the circus.
Not glamorous, rarely thanked, but without them nothing gets signed off.

- Needs to **think on their feet** — because no plan survives contact with reality.
- Must be **proactive** — spotting risks and blockers before anyone else notices.
- Professional **nag** — asks the same question until it’s answered, then asks “why” five more times.
- Acts as **CRM in human form** — calming panicked customers, smoothing rough edges, and keeping the relationship alive.
- Filters the **BS from sales** before it infects delivery.
- Keeps **SMEs out of the weeds**, pulling them back when they disappear into the tall grass.
- Holds the **evidence folder** like it’s the Ten Commandments — because it is.

# Doer (Subject Matter Expert)

The person who actually knows how to do the thing.  
Essential, brilliant at times, but prone to wandering off into details that don’t matter to the customer.  

- Deep **technical or process expertise** — they know how things *actually* work.
- **Critical to delivery**, but their priorities don’t always match project priorities.
- Tend to drift into **detail obsession** unless pulled back.
- Often **underestimate effort** because “it should be easy.”
- Can be persuaded by customers to do “quick favours” outside scope.
- When managed tightly, they are the **engine room**.
- When unmanaged, they are the **drain** that sucks time, budget, and patience.

# Opportunity Whip (Sales Mangager)

- Brings in the deal and sets the initial tone with the customer.
- Frames the vision, sometimes bigger than delivery can support.
- Without them, no projects — but they often leave gaps for the PM to close.
- Works closely with Account Managers to “smooth the handover.”
- Needs the PM to translate sales language into delivery language.

# Continuity Keeper (Account Manager)

- Protects the relationship after the Opportunity Driver (Sales) has won the deal.
- Ensures handover from promise → delivery → support feels seamless.
- Provides the “strategic partner” language that keeps customers engaged long-term.
- Absorbs heat when delivery stumbles and reframes it as “we’re in this together.”
- Balances customer trust with internal reality — the diplomat in the loop.
