# Stakeholder Stakes

Every stakeholder is in the project for a reason. They have something to gain, or protect, or avoid.  
Your job as the [Alchemist (PM)](./roles.md#the-alchemist-project-manager) is to drag that out into the open and write it down.  

If you don’t know what their stake is, you don’t know what game you’re playing.

## The Rule of Stakes

- Customer stake always comes first.
- Internal, partner, 3rd party stakes are secondary.
- If stakes clash, the customer’s wins.

## How to Capture Stakes

- During [stakeholder kick-offs](./3_kickoffs.md), ask bluntly: *what are you hoping to get out of this project?*
- Don’t settle for vague answers like “success” or “efficiency.” Push until it’s concrete.
- Document each group’s stake in plain language.

**Example:**

| Stakeholder                                             | Stake (What they want)                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Custodian (Customer KDM)](./roles.md#the-custodian-customer---kdmspoc) | Reporting system live by end of quarter         |
| [Knight (Internal Dev Lead)](./roles.md#the-knight-sme)               | Build portfolio by shipping API successfully    |
| [Gatekeeper (Partner Vendor)](./roles.md#the-gatekeepers-3rd-parties-artisans-potential-blockers) | Lock in long-term support contract              |
| [Castellan (Account Manager)](./roles.md#the-castellan-account-manager) | Maintain customer health score above 90%       |

## The Stake Map

Keep all stakes on a single page.
This becomes your **Stake Map** — a living artefact you can pull out whenever conflicts flare up. See [Stake Maps](../reference/terminology.md#stake-maps) for more context on when and how to use them.

- Use a simple table (as above).
  - You can add in power and influence dynamics, there are examples on the web. Use what works for the situation.
- Update it as stakes shift.
- Share only with discretion — sometimes the politics are sensitive.

## When Stakes Collide

Conflicts are inevitable. When they happen:  
1. Pull the Stake Map into the room.
2. Lay out the clash in black and white.
3. Remind everyone: *customer stake comes first*.
4. Force a decision — what stays, what bends, what breaks.
